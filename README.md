McMinneville, OR project to display and manipulate data using JavaScript

Overview
This purpose of this project was to build an interactive website to present data. JavaScript was used to assemble the data and make the content dynamic through user input. HTML and Bootstrap were used to customize the website and make it attractive and easy to use. This project focused on presenting UFO data for an amateur ufologist. 

Results 
The resulting website provided an introductory paragraph with a large table of data. Four custom filters that allowed the website user to filter the table to make the information more consumable and relevant to their needs. Here is the full website:

In order to execute a search, one or more of the filter fields need user input. This example shows a search on the state of Colorado and the resulting data from the search: 


Summary
This website can provide the required data but the filter fields only work if the capitalization of the user input matches the data set exactly. For instance, if we filter by CO for Colorado rather than co, this is the result:

To improve the website, there are a couple of areas that could improve useability. A "Filter/Clear" button may improved user interaction as currently, it is not clear what makes the filter 'work' nor how to clear the search criteria. This would entail further development of the code that 'listens' for changes in the filters. The placeholder text is a bit dark and looks as though it is a search criteria rather than a placeholder. These slight adjustments to the provided code would make the website more useable.
